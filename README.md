An ADAS System using Lane and Object Detection System used for two major tasks.
1. Detects the required angle of steering by calculating the shift of the vehicle from the center of the lane.
2. Alerts the driver and provides necessary feedbacks after detecting nearby objects in the environment such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signals etc.
